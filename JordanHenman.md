## Top 25 Software CWE Deep Dive

After reading through the top 25 CWEs I eventually chose CWE-269, which I belive to have encountered a few times in my code submissions.

### Explanation of CWE-269

[CWE-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html) is a vulnerability related to improper privilege management. Mitre.org states that with CWE-26, "The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.". This essentially means that 

### Example CVEs



### Fake CPE



### Personal Experience

In a project I worked on [describe the project briefly], I implemented code that was vulnerable to CWE-XYZ. This vulnerability [briefly explain how the vulnerability manifested in your code].

### Mitigation and Code Improvement

The best way to prevent this vulnerability is to assign the least amount of necessary privileges for the program/code to run.
