# Vulnerabilty Taxonomy Homework

## Top 25 Software CWE Deep Dive

After reading through the top 25 CWEs I eventually chose CWE-918, server-side request forgery. 
 
### Explanation of CWE-918

* [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)

CWE-918 is when "The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.". Esentially server-side request forgery allows an attacker to make a sever perform unintended network requests. This lets the attacker access sensitive information or services.

### Example CVEs

* [CVE-2021-26866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-26855) - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV
* [CVE-2021-21973](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21973) - Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV
* [CVE-2016-4029](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4029) - Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism 

### Personal Experience?

I choose CWE-918 simply because I thought it was interesting, I was not able to compare it or any CWE to my previous codes because they all got deleted when I got a new laptop. To make up for this I searched for real world SSRF attacks and found one of the most well known.

In 2019 CapitalOne was attacked using an SSRF which resulted in more than 100 million customer reports being leaked to the hackers. This attack occured through Amazon AWS, which hosted CapitalOne's servers. The attacker was able to access AWS credentials using an SSRF and used these credentials to steal the data.

### Fake CPE

Since I couldn't make a fake CPE I decided to find the CPE of AWS. I searched through the National Vulnerability Database for Amazon AWS in 2019 and found this:

    cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_javascript_s3_explorer:2019-08-02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

### Mitigation and Code Improvement

A few ways to mitigate SSRF is to:

* Use Input Validation
* Use Explicit URL Whitelisting
* Use DNS Whitelisting
* Disable Unused Ports/Protocols
* Educate Developers
